# Nginx Reverse Proxy

## Overview

Nginx serves as the reverse proxy and web server for the URL shortening application, providing intelligent request routing, load balancing, static file serving, and security enforcement. It acts as the primary entry point for all client requests, optimizing performance and ensuring reliable service delivery.

## Architecture Role

### Request Flow Management
Nginx handles incoming requests and routes them to appropriate backend services based on URL patterns and request types. This centralized approach ensures efficient resource utilization and consistent user experience.

### Core Responsibilities
- **Request Routing**: Intelligent distribution based on URL patterns and content types
- **Load Balancing**: Even distribution of requests across backend instances
- **Static Content Delivery**: High-performance serving of frontend assets
- **Security Enforcement**: Request filtering, rate limiting, and security headers
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, compression, and connection management

## Service Architecture

### Traffic Routing Logic
```
Client Request → Nginx Analysis → Service Routing:

┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
│ Request Pattern     │ Destination Service         │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ /api/*             │ FastAPI Backend (Port 8000) │
│ /{shortcode}       │ FastAPI Backend (Redirects) │
│ /static/*          │ Static File Server          │
│ /*                 │ React Frontend (Port 3000)  │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Request Processing Examples
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/shorten` → Backend service for URL creation
- **URL Redirects**: `/abc123` → Backend service for URL resolution
- **Frontend Routes**: `/dashboard` → React application routing
- **Static Assets**: `/css/style.css` → Direct file serving with caching

## Configuration Management

### Configuration Structure
```
nginx/
├── nginx.conf    # Primary server configuration and routing rules
└── README.md     # Documentation and setup instructions
```

### Configuration Components
- **Routing Directives**: URL pattern matching and service delegation
- **Performance Tuning**: Worker processes, connection limits, and timeout settings
- **Security Policies**: Rate limiting, access controls, and security headers
- **Caching Strategy**: Static asset caching and proxy cache configuration

## Performance Optimization

### Static Content Delivery
- **Asset Caching**: Long-term browser caching for static resources (CSS, JS, images)
- **Gzip Compression**: 70% reduction in file sizes for faster transmission
- **Keep-Alive Connections**: Connection reuse for improved efficiency
- **Worker Optimization**: Auto-scaling worker processes based on CPU cores

### Caching Implementation
- **URL Redirect Caching**: 60-second cache for frequently accessed short URLs
- **Static Asset Caching**: 1-year cache duration for versioned frontend assets
- **Proxy Buffering**: Optimized buffer sizes for backend communication

## Security Architecture

### Access Control and Rate Limiting
- **API Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per second per client IP for API endpoints
- **Redirect Rate Limiting**: 50 requests per second per client IP for URL redirects
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers for XSS and clickjacking protection
- **File Access Control**: Restricted access to configuration files and hidden directories

### Security Implementation
```
Security Measures:
├── Blocked file access (.env, .config files)
├── Hidden file protection (.*) 
├── Rate limiting by client IP address
├── Security headers for all responses
└── Input validation and request filtering
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Docker Integration
Automated deployment through Docker Compose:

1. **Service Initialization**: Nginx container startup with volume mounting
2. **Configuration Loading**: nginx.conf loaded from host filesystem
3. **Backend Integration**: Automatic service discovery for FastAPI backend
4. **Frontend Integration**: Static file serving and SPA routing for React application
5. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and service monitoring

### Manual Administration
```bash
# Validate configuration syntax
nginx -t

# Start Nginx service
nginx

# Reload configuration without downtime
nginx -s reload

# Graceful shutdown
nginx -s quit
```

## System Architecture

### Server Configuration
- **Port**: HTTP traffic on port 80 (standard web port)
- **Worker Processes**: Automatically scaled to match CPU core count
- **Connection Capacity**: 1024 concurrent connections per worker process
- **Timeout Settings**: Optimized for fast response and resource efficiency

### Backend Integration
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient backend connection management
- **Health Checks**: Automatic backend health monitoring
- **Load Balancing**: Ready for multiple backend instance distribution
- **Failover**: Graceful handling of backend service interruptions

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Logging Configuration
- **Access Logs**: Comprehensive request logging with response times and status codes
- **Error Logs**: Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting and maintenance
- **Performance Metrics**: Request processing times and throughput analysis

### Operational Commands
```bash
docker-compose logs -f nginx

curl -I http://localhost:8080/health

tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```
